Reservation System in Java

A simple console-based reservation system implemented in Java. The system allows users to make reservations, view all reservations, cancel reservations, and exit the system. The system uses a simple array-based data structure to store reservations and provides a text-based user interface.

Features:

Make a reservation with name, date, and number of guests
View all reservations
Cancel a reservation by ID
Exit the system

Implementation:

The system uses three classes: 'Reservation', 'ReservationSystem', and 'ReservationSystemUI'
The 'Reservation' class represents a single reservation with ID, name, date, and number of guests
The 'ReservationSystem' class manages the reservations and provides methods for making, viewing, and canceling reservations
The 'ReservationSystemUI' class provides a text-based user interface for interacting with the system
Note:

This is a simplified implementation and may not be suitable for production use. It is intended for educational or demonstration purposes only.
