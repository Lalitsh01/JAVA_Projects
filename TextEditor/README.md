## Code Overview üìú

The main class `editor` extends `JFrame` and implements `ActionListener` to handle various menu actions. Below is a detailed explanation of the key components and functionalities:

### Constructor

The constructor initializes the GUI components and sets up the look and feel of the application:

- **Frame**: A `JFrame` named `f` is created with the title "editor".
- **Look and Feel**: The metal look and feel is set, with the Ocean theme applied.
- **Text Area**: A `JTextArea` named `t` is created for text input and editing.
- **Menu Bar**: A `JMenuBar` named `mb` is created to hold the menus.
- **File Menu**: A `JMenu` named `m1` is created with menu items for file operations (New, Open, Save, Print).
- **Edit Menu**: A `JMenu` named `m2` is created with menu items for text editing operations (Cut, Copy, Paste).
- **Close Option**: A menu item for closing the application is also added to the menu bar.

### Action Handling

The `actionPerformed` method handles actions triggered by the menu items:

- **Cut**: `t.cut()` - Cuts the selected text.
- **Copy**: `t.copy()` - Copies the selected text.
- **Paste**: `t.paste()` - Pastes the copied/cut text.
- **Save**: Opens a `JFileChooser` to select a file location and saves the text content to the selected file.
- **Print**: Prints the current text content using `t.print()`.
- **Open**: Opens a `JFileChooser` to select and load a text file into the text area.
- **New**: Clears the text area for a new document.
- **Close**: Closes the application window.

### File Operations

- **Save**: When the Save menu item is selected, a `JFileChooser` is displayed. If a file is selected, the content of the text area is written to the file using a `BufferedWriter`.
- **Open**: When the Open menu item is selected, a `JFileChooser` is displayed. If a file is selected, the content of the file is read using a `BufferedReader` and displayed in the text area.
- **Print**: The current content of the text area is sent to the printer.

### Edit Operations

- **Cut, Copy, Paste**: These operations are directly performed on the text area using the respective methods `cut()`, `copy()`, and `paste()`.
